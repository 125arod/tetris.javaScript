Tetris notes
Must do:
- grid based game
- five shapes
- high score by filling rows,
- dispearing row to get points
- Grid to the side of the grid to show the next shape


Setting up the project
- Decide on a code editor. Atom, intelliJ, webstorm
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js


HTML Basics
- Add script tag JS file to HTMML
- Add Link tag css file to HTML
- Make grid 20 blocks high, 10 blocks wide. (Could use for loop to do this). .grid
- Display score, #score
- start button to start the game #start-button

CSS basics
 - Assign grid dimension. 
 - .grid div will be used to reference only the divs in the grid class
 - use flex box to wrap within grid
 - color the tetromino shapes. 

App.js
- Remember let ,const and var
- Dom event listener for index.html link
- Tell the JS the width of squares, const can come in handy
- grid variable querySelector can be used to find the grid class. assign it to a variable. 
- square variables have a square array and store all the divs in an array.
- Score variable
- start-button variable
- draw the shapes using classList.add()
- lShape - an array with width [1, width+1,width*2+1,2] 
- Draw function to shape.
- Undraw function to remove the shape. 
- Add a timerId
- moveShape function to undraw the shape adjust the current position and redraw it to have it move downwards. 
- freeze function to if statement to check if one of the squares contains taken, each square in shape will be taken, once it is taken it will create a new shape and begin again.
- write a set of rules to stop it from moving through the sides
